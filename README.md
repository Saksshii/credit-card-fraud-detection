## 🚨 Problem Statement

Traditional rule-based systems in banks often fail to detect evolving fraudulent behavior. Fraudulent transactions not only cause financial losses but also erode customer trust. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system that identifies potential fraud in real-time with high accuracy and interpretability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess transactional data (cleaning, feature selection, and balancing).
- Implement and compare ML algorithms like:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Artificial Neural Networks
- Evaluate models using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Analyze model interpretability and real-world feasibility.
- Document results and limitations for deployment considerations.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle & Open ML repositories
- **Size**: ~280,000 transactions
- **Class Distribution**: Highly imbalanced (~0.172% fraudulent)

> Note: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling) was used to handle class imbalance.
